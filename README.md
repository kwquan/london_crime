A data-centric approach for the London Knife Pandemic

In recent years, news reports indicate a rise in knife attacks in London. Using the London Crime Statistics dataset provided by Google,
we plot 10 visualizations that summarizes trends in crimes committed in London and to determine if this is indeed the case. 
Kindly follow the steps below:

1) Download public dataset from Google's Bigquery[london_crime > crime_by_lsoa] (As the file is huge, kindly google the steps required to 
download all file segments to local folder if unsure)
2) Upload all file segments to Jupyter
3) Run ipynb file & observe the visualizations
